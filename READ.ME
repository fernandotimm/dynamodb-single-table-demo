This project was created for the purpose of showcasing a bug to the Dynamoose team.
It contains a simple test to help reproducing a probable bug on the Query function.

The idea is to use the Query() function instead of the Scan() function in order to follow the recommendations of DB modeling as seen on AWS re:Invent 2019. 
Here's the complete video of the talk: https://youtu.be/DIQVJqiSUkE


Install dependencies:
$ yarn
or
$ npm install

Run a local DynamoDB instance using the docker-compose file
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d

Run the simple test to insert fake data and to run the query functions to list them
$ yarn test
or
$ npm run test

You should see the error:
"Index can't be found for query."
